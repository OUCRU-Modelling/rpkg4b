### Post creation

-   Install `usethis` and `devtools`

-   Generate a license for your package:

    -   Open-source: run `usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder=NULL)` in RStudio `Console`

    -   Proprietary: `usethis::use_proprietary_license(copyright_holder)` in RStudio `Console`

    -   Other [license options](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/licenses.html#ref-usage)...

-   Generate a read me file: run `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` in RStudio `Console`

-   (optional) Update information inside the `DESCRIPTION` file. Some fields of interest:

    -   `Title`: what the package does

    -   `Description`: more detailed information about the package (in one paragraph)

    -   `Depends`: list of package's dependencies for core functions (your package **require** these external packages to work)

    -   `Suggest`: list of package's dependencies for development tasks or optional functions (for example: packages used for testing)

    -   `Authors`: list of package's authors. Read [`Author`](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#sec-description-authors-at-r) section for the format.

-   (optional) Upload to Github

    -   Create a new repository on Github

    -   Open `Terminal` (To open Terminal in R studio, click `Tools` \> `Terminal` \> `New Terminal` )

    -   Run the following snippet in RStudio `Terminal` (replace {link to repo} with your repo link)

        ```{bash, eval = F}
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit"
        git remote add origin {link to repo}                        
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
        ```

    -   Demo upload github {{< video img/upload_to_github.mp4 >}}

## Writing the first function

### Write it

-   Create a file to place your function into. The file must be created in R folder with the naming convention: `function_name.R`. To create the file, there are 2 options:
    -   Use RStudio to navigate to `R` folder and click `New Blank File` \> `R Script`
    -   Run `usethis::use_r("filename")` in `Console`
-   Define a function

Example: Create a `square.R` that contains the following snippet

```{r}
square <- function(x) {
  return(x * x)
}
```

### Document it

-   Install `roxygen2`

-   Generate and update the roxygen documentation on top of the function. (Refer to demo video)

-   Run `roxygen2::roxygenise()` or `devtools::document()` to generate documents.

```{r}
#' Square a number 
#' 
#' Takes a number x and returns its square, x * x. 
#' 
#' @param x A numeric value to be squared. 
#' @return The square of x. 
#' @examples 
#' square(2) 
#' square(-5.7) 
#' 
#' @export 
square <- function(x) { 
  return(x * x) 
}
```

## Trouble shooting NAMESPACE

If `roxygen2::roxygenise()` prints out the following message

`✖ Skipping NAMESPACE It already exists and was not generated by roxygen2.`

delete the current NAMESPACE file and rerun the command
:::

### Caveat (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ✧

Reuse built-in function names instead of creating new ones

Some reusable function names: `plot`, `print`, `toString`

To reuse function name:

-   Modify original function to add class to it

-   Write a custom function for your class

Example: overriding `plot` function for class `square`

```{r}
square <- function(x) {
  out <- x * x 
  class(out) <- "square" # tell R that ouptut is of class "square"
  return(out)
}

# --- Override plot function
plot.square <- function(x, ...) {
  plot(c(1:length(x)), x, xlab = "x", ylab = "Square of x", ...)
}

# --- Test the new plot function 
y <- square(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10))
plot(y)
```

## Set up quality control

### Unit testing

**Makes sure your functions work as expected.**

-   Install `devtools`, `usethis`

-   Create a test: run `usethis::use_test("test_name")` in RStudio `Console`. This would create a file named `"test-test_name.R"` under `tests/testthat` folder

Example: unit test for `square` function

```{r, warning=F}
library(testthat)
test_that("square(3) returns 9", {
  # --- Define expected output
  expected <- 9
  class(expected) <- "square" 
  # --- Test function
  actual <-  square(3)
  expect_equal(actual, expected)
})
```

::: callout-tip
Run `devtools::test()` in R to run all tests in package

### Code coverage

**View coverage report locally**

-   Install `covr`

-   Run `covr::report()`

**Show your test coverage on Github**

-   Import `devtools` and `covr`

-   Push your package to GitHub

-   Run `use_coverage(type = c("codecov"))`

-   Run `use_github_action("test-coverage")`

-   Login [http://codecov.io](http://codecov.io/) and get your repo's token

-   Run `codecov(token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")`

::: callout-tip
#### ![](img/codecov.png){width="234"} {.callout-tip}
:::

### Automatic R CMD check

**Test your package locally**

Run `devtools::check()` in R console to test the package

**Ensure your changes doesn't cause the package to failed to build.**

-   Re-knit readme: `devtools::build_readme()`

-   Run:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    usethis::use_github_action_check_standard(
      save_as = "R-CMD-check.yaml",
      ref = NULL, ignore = TRUE, open = FALSE)

    ```

::: callout-tip

## Package down

**Share your package with the world 🌎.**

-   Install `pkgdown`

-   Run `usethis::use_pkgdown()`

-   Run `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`

-   Create an empty branch for hosting your page.

    -   Run the following snippet in Terminal
    -   To open Terminal in R studio, click `Tools` \> `Terminal` \> `New Terminal`

```{bash, eval=F}
git checkout --orphan gh-pages     
git rm -rf .     
git commit --allow-empty -m 'Initial gh-pages commit'    
git push origin gh-pages     
git checkout master
```

## R package with STAN

### Quick start

-   Install `rstantools` and `rstan` packages

-   Run one of the following commands:

    -   `rstantools::rstan_create_package(path = "pkgname")` to create [**new package**]{.underline} with STAN functionality

    -   `rstantools::use_rstan()` to add STAN functionality to [**existing package**]{.underline}

-   Store your STAN models (.stan files) under `inst/` folder

-   Run `rstan::config()` after adding STAN models (make sure to do this after adding or updating STAN model)

-   Run `devtools::document()` to compile STAN models. You should find the translated C++ files under `src/` folder

-   Write your R function under `R/` folder just like normal, and your STAN models is accessible via `stanmodels$model_name`

### Additional material

-   [A quick guide for R package that uses rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstantools/vignettes/minimal-rstan-package.html#documentation)

-   Example for a function with STAN functionality: [`serosv::hierarchical_bayesian_model()`](https://github.com/OUCRU-Modelling/serosv/blob/main/R/hierarchical_bayesian_model.R)

::: callout-important
### Warnings on Mac {.callout-important}

Mac users may encounter WARNING during `devtools::check()` with the following message

`checking top-level files ... WARNING A complete check needs the 'checkbashisms' script. See section ‘Configure and cleanup’ in the ‘Writing R Extensions’ manual.`

that may persists even after installing `checkbashisms` via terminal. This may be caused by RStudio using different `$PATH`. To resolve this, there are 3 options:

-   [Change PATH manually](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/10551)

-   Remove `configure`, `configure.win` which are the files that need to be checked (not recommended)

-   Or simply ignore the message since CRAN check system will have `checkbashisms` anyways
:::

## Releasing to CRAN

### Release workflow

The most concrete expression of the release process is the checklist produced by [`usethis::use_release_issue()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_release_issue.html), which opens a GitHub issue containing a list of todo's.

```{=html}
<details>
  <summary>
    The generated checklist would include the following
  </summary>
```
First release:

-   [ ]  `usethis::use_news_md()`

-   [ ]  `usethis::use_cran_comments()`

-   [ ]  Update (aspirational) install instructions in README

-   [ ]  Proofread `Title:` and `Description:`

-   [ ]  Check that all exported functions have `@return` and `@examples`

-   [ ]  Check that `Authors@R:` includes a copyright holder (role 'cph')

-   [ ]  Check [licensing of included files](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html#sec-code-you-bundle)

-   [ ]  Review <https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks>

Prepare for release:

-   [ ]  `git pull`

-   [ ]  `urlchecker::url_check()`

-   [ ]  `devtools::build_readme()`

-   [ ]  `devtools::check(remote = TRUE, manual = TRUE)`

-   [ ]  `devtools::check_win_devel()`

-   [ ]  `git push`

Submit to CRAN:

-   [ ]  `usethis::use_version('patch')`

-   [ ]  `devtools::submit_cran()`

-   [ ]  Approve email

Wait for CRAN\...

-   [ ]  Accepted 🎉

-   [ ]  `usethis::use_github_release()`

-   [ ]  `usethis::use_dev_version(push = TRUE)`

-   [ ]  `usethis::use_news_md()`

</details>

But to summarize the process, there are 3 stages for the submission process

**Local checks**

-   Run `devtools::check()` and resolve any ERRORs, WARNINGs, and try to not have any NOTEs if possible (as CRAN will not allow some specific NOTEs). After resolving all issues, copy and paste the check result to `cran-comments.md` (generated by `usethis::use_cran_comment()`)

-   If you find some NOTEs are un-resolvable, make sure to also include the NOTEs and explanation in `cran-comments.md`

-   Make sure to double check documentations following the checklist

**Run check on servers**

There are several R functions to check package compatibility on other OS

-   Run `devtools::check_win_devel()` to check your package on a Windows server

-   Run `devtools::check_mac_release()` to check your package on a MacOS server

If there are any OS-specific issues, make sure to note that in `cran-comments.md` as well

**Submission**

-   Call `usethis::use_version()` to update your package version number then submit to cran with `devtools::submit_cran()`

-   Wait for CRAN email, but be prepared for several rejections before your package is finally approved

-   Once you received the approval email, generate a github release using  `usethis::use_github_release()` and update version to development mode using  `usethis::use_dev_version(push = TRUE)`

### Common issues and how to resolve them

-   `devtools::check()` don't like tidyverse syntax (`NOTE:` `no visible binding for global variable …` ) This can be ignored but make sure to [include explanation for this NOTE in cran-comments.md](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9439256/how-can-i-handle-r-cmd-check-no-visible-binding-for-global-variable-notes-when)

-   Note regarding package size (`checking installed package size … NOTE`). Similarly, this NOTE can be ignored but require a explanation in `cran-comments.md`

### Things that needed to be double check before submission

-   Include contributors, references: make sure that you include authors of any code you copied for your package, and any reference for your methodology
-   Document your code properly: make sure your roxygen all include @return tag and explain the returned result

### Caveats

**About DESCRIPTION file**

-   `Author` list: if part of your code is derived, copied from other sources, the authors of such code must be included in Author field with 'ctb' (contributor) role

-   `Description` section:

    -   When functions are mentioned, make sure it follows the format `function_name()`

    -   When packages or software names are mentioned, make sure to place them in single quotes (`'package_name'`)

    -   When refer to publication titles, make sure to place them in double quotes (`"publication title"`)

**About LICENSE file**

-   **Github** vs **CRAN** `LICENSE` file: since `LICENSE` file for Github and CRAN follows different formats, a work around is to have a `LICENSE.md` file for Github and a `LICENSE` file for CRAN (make sure `LICENSE.md` is in included in `.Rbuildignore`). This is usually automatically handled when LICENSE is generated by `usethis::use_{license_name}_license()`
